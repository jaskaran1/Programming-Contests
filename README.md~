Programming-Contests
====================
My solutions for some of the problems which I solved on various online judges like codechef,HackerRank,ProjectEuler,SPOJ.

I also implemented a code checker which compares the output of your program and the expected output text file character by character and reports the point of mismatch.A handy tool to check if output is correct or not in cases where there is very large output.

The FacebookChallenge folder contains the problem Balance whose solution I coded for the facebook internship 2013 and was successful in doing so under the time limit of 90 minutes.

Happy coding :)
